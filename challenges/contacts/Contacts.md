### Problem: `Contacts`

Hackerrank Link - https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/contacts/problem


### Description

We're going to make our own Contacts application! The application must perform two types of operations:

- `add` `name`, where `name` is a string denoting a contact name. This must store `name`  as a new contact in the application.
- `find partial`, where `partial` is a string denoting a partial name to search the application for. It must count the number of contacts starting with `partial` and print the count on a new line.

Given  sequential add and find operations, perform each operation in order.
